Live Football World Cup Score Board

According to following requirements:

1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
a. Home team
b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.

I created implementaation and tests regarding:
* start match
* finish match
* update score
* remove match after finish match from scoreboard
* get summary games with sorted match list according to requirements
